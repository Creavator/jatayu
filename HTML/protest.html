            </div>
             <div id="description">
                The incident garnered widespread media coverage and triggering outrage across the nation especially within the medical community, as student unions and colleagues of the deceased demanded justice and improved security measures on campus.[6]

                    In response, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) called on Union Health Minister J. P. Nadda to introduce a special central law aimed at preventing violence against doctors. They also urged that hospitals be designated as safe zones. This appeal follows widespread protests and strikes by resident doctors across the country in response to the heinous crime, raising serious concerns about the safety of medical staff.[22]
                    
                    On 13 August protests escalated as more than 8,000 government doctors in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, the financial capital of India, halted work in all hospital departments except for emergency services, according to media reports. In New Delhi, junior doctors wearing white coats staged a protest outside major government hospitals. Emergency services stayed suspended on 13 August in almost all the government-run medical college hospitals in Kolkata. Similar protests in cities such as Lucknow, and Goa hit some hospital services.[23] Protests by junior doctors were being held at all the major medical institutions in Delhi and Kolkata including AIIMS Delhi, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital, Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital as well as the R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital.[24]
                    
                    The Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) on 12 August, announced an indefinite nationwide suspension of elective services as a form of protest. The protests were called off on 13 August after a delegation of the IMA and other groups had met the Health Minister J. P. Nadda. Several resident doctor's associations in India like the Federation of All India Medical Associations (FAIMA) as well as AIIMS Delhi, Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital, Calcutta National Medical College, R. G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, Indira Gandhi Medical College Dwarka have continued their stir.[25][26] Two days of calling off the strike, the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) resumed its strike after the violence in the R.G. Kar Medical College.[27]
                    
                    Large protests and candlelight marches were held by the medical fraternity as well as women starting from the midnight of 14 August. The protests were named as "Women, Reclaim the Night" were held in Delhi and Kolkata.[28]
                    
                    
                    "Reclaim the night" protests during the night of 14 August
                    On 15 August, shortly after midnight, police used tear gas and a baton charge as a group of unidentified miscreants masquerading as protesters toppled the barricade and entered the premises of the hospital. The miscreants pelted stones at the hospital premises and vandalised the emergency ward, resulting in several policemen and protesting civilians getting injured. Kolkata Police commissioner Vineet Goyal blamed the "malicious media campaign" against the Kolkata police for the violent protest.
